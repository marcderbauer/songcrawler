# SongCrawler

Crawl Spotify and Genius for all the songs of your favourite artist!

## :exclamation: Requirements

This program was built using <code>Python 3.10</code>.  
Older versions may work, but are currently not supported.  

You will also need to setup access to the Spotify and Genius APIs. More on that below.

## :open_mouth: About

This program is a tool for data scientists and NLP enthusiasts who would like to gather data on music. It gathers two types of data: Spotify audio features and lyrics.

Spotify audio features are metrics about songs which were generated by Spotify and are accessible through their API. As the name implies, the features are audio related and include some interesting measurements, such as *dancability* or *acousticness*. A full list of features the API provides can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/).

The lyrics are gathered through the Genius API.

## :robot: Setup

#### 1. Install the Required Dependencies  

    pip install -r requirements.txt

#### 2. Setup Spotify API
  This repository makes use of [Spotipy](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy) to access the Spotify API. If you're interested in the statistics gathered from Spotify, you might want to checkout the [Spotipy Documentation](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.21.0/).
  To query data from the API, you first need to create an app as [Spotify developer](https://developers.spotify.com/). You need to do this in order to get a `client_id` and `client_secret`.  
  
  You need to export the credentials as environment variables `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` respectively.
    
  Here is a little tutorial on how to get the credentials:

#### 3. Setup Genius API
  Lyrics are gathered using [LyricsGenius](https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius) to access the [Genius.com](https://genius.com/) API.   
    
  The first step to access the API is to create a Genius account. Once you have the account, you can use it to [generate a client access token](http://genius.com/api-clients). You need to export this as the environment variable `GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
    
After setting up both the Spotify and Genius API you are ready to go.

## How It Works

Explain :)

Here on usage as:

1. CLI
2. Python class

Main use-case is CLI, so elaborate more on that.

## Contribute

I'm happy about any feedback, contribution, etc.
